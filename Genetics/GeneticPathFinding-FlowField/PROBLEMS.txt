PROBLEMS

0 - IT'S NOT GETTING THE FUCKING JOB DONE

1 - Acceleration is creating a hard time for steering the creature

2 - Not getting 2 parents
	Maybe it's a bad idea, because getting the average will change the path a lot
	Or it will just make it in a long run

3 - Missing some kind of obstacle for the creatures

4 - I'm not actually using a flowfield with noise(), it's completely random

5 - Creature not pointing to the correct direction when moving
